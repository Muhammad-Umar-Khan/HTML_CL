HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

HyperText means that it uses the HTTP part of the Internet
Markup means the code you write is annotated with keywords
Language means it can be read by both a human and a computer

<strong> for important words
<em> for emphasized words
<a> for links
<small> for less important words
<abbr> for abbreviations like W3C

To tell the browser that the HTML document is an HTML 5, just start your document with the following line:

<!DOCTYPE html>

git branch -m old-name new-name.
