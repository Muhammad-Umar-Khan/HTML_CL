      (first paragraph) Well, Ja should know his own business, I thought, and so
      I grasped the spear and clambered up toward the red man as rapidly as I
      could - being so far removed from my simian ancestors as I am
    </p>
    <p class="second">
      I imagine the slow-witted sithic, as Ja called him, suddenly realized our
      intentions and that he was quite likely to lose all his meal instead of
      having it doubled as he had hoped

      It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge
      in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was watching the
      fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the Martians had resumed
      the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts
      that have been put forth, the majority of them remained busied with
      preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurrying on some
      operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke.
